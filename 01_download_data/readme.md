Record mouse clicks with record_mouse_clicks.py


Download conference calls with download_conference_calls_from_thomsonone.py

Check that the .pdf and .xls files are in pairs with check_if_pdf_and_xls_are_in_pairs.py

Combine xls files to get xls_combined.xlsx.

Scroll through the rows of xls_combined.xlsx, and check for any entries with "The application encountered an internal error.  Research: Unknown error". These happen when the xls file is not downloaded correctly, so find the corrupted xls file and redownload it from Thomson One.
