# ConferenceCallCode

- This folder contains all codes for the conference call project. 
- It is cloned into both Dropbox (your work laptop) and Mercury under .../conference_call/code, 
so the two folders are identical as long as commits, pushes and pull requests are made regularly.
- The folder structure and folder names were standardized after all codes were run, so the folder and file paths in some code files will need to be updated as well.
- Main pipeline are in folders `01` to `05`, in order. Additional tasks (usually one-off) are in `misc`.
- The env folders contain some data for the Python environment in Mercury. This is not yet synchronized.
